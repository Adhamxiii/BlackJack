# üÉè Blackjack Game

This is a simple implementation of a Blackjack game created using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

## Description

The application allows a player to play a round of Blackjack against the computer. It keeps track of the cards drawn and the player's total sum. The game logic is simple and only supports drawing new cards and ending the round.

## Features

- **Start Game**: Initializes the game, dealing two cards to the player.
- **New Card**: Draws a new card and adds its value to the player's total.
- **Blackjack**: Instant win if the player's cards total 21.
- **Bust**: Ends the round if the player's card total exceeds 21.

## Getting Started

To run the game, open the [Live Demo](#live-demo) file in a web browser.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Game Logic

- The game uses basic rules to calculate the sum of drawn cards.
- An Ace card counts as 11 unless the sum exceeds 21; then, it counts as 1.
- The game ends if the player decides to 'Stand' or if they exceed 21.

## Improvements

The current version is a rudimentary implementation. Possible improvements can be made in:

- Adding more features, such as splitting or doubling down.
- Introducing a dealer with AI logic.
- Implementing better design and UI.
